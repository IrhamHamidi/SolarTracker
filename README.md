# SolarTracker
Final Class Project

Design and construct a Dual-Axis Solar Tracker (DAST) that tracks the sun path and keep the photovoltaic (PV) panel perpendicular to the sun throughout the day to increase the percentage of the electrical energy that can be generated. By using solar energy to generate electricity, it can reduce the percentage of pollution caused by generating energy using fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
